Hi everyone! My name is Suaib Zakaria. I work in furniture design, where I create 3D models for rendering, detailed 2D drawings, and furniture cost estimates based on actual sample measurements — and sometimes design the drawings before the sample is produced. This is an example of my work at the company.
